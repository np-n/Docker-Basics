<h4>Object oriented language  Application</h4>
As a middle-level language, C combines benefits of both low machine level languages and high-level developer friendly languages.  Further, it is fast, structured, portable and has a rich library. These features make C a general purpose programming language, and hence, it finds application across every domain in programming world.

A super set of C, C++ is an object-oriented programming language and incorporates all the features offered by C. C++ started its journey as C with classes. Gradually, it has evolved and despite the popularity of other programming languages like C# and Java, C, C++ holds its own as one of the most widely used languages for scripting.  In applications, C++ is ubiquitous.

Real-World Applications of C
<ul>
 <li>Operating Systems:
 
 

Scripting of UNIX operating system was the primary purpose behind creation of C. Additionally, as programs scripted in C get executed with speeds equivalent to assembly language, C language has been an integral part of the development of multiple operating systems. Unix-Kernel, Microsoft Windows utilities and operating system applications, and a large segment of the Android operating system have all been scripted in C.

<li>Development of New Languages:


Efficiency of code execution and simplicity have resulted in C directly or indirectly influencing development of many languages including C++ which is C with classes, C#, D, Java, Limbo, JavaScript, Perl, UNIX’s C Shell, PHP and Python, and Verilog. These languages use C in variable capacity: for instance, in Python, C is used for building standard libraries, while others like C++, Perl and PHP have syntax and control structures based upon C.

<li>Computation Platforms:


C implements algorithms and data structures swiftly, facilitating faster computations in programs. This has enabled the use of C in applications requiring higher degrees of calculations like MATLAB and Mathematica.

<li>Embedded Systems:


Various features of C including direct access to machine level hardware APIs, presence of C compilers, deterministic resource use and dynamic memory allocation make C language an optimum choice for scripting applications and drivers of embedded systems.

<li>Graphics and Games:


C language has been used in the development of a variety of graphics and gaming applications, such as chess, bouncing ball, archery etc.
</ul>
<h4>Real-World Applications of C++</h4>
<ul>
<li> Games:


C++ overrides the complexities of 3D games, optimizes resource management and facilitates multiplayer with networking. The language is extremely fast, allows procedural programming for CPU intensive functions and provides greater control over hardware, because of which it has been widely used in development of gaming engines. For instance, the science fiction game Doom 3 is cited as an example of a game that used C++ well and the Unreal Engine, a suite of game development tools, is written in C++.

<li>Graphic User Interface (GUI) based applications:

Many highly used applications, such as Image Ready, Adobe Premier, Photoshop and Illustrator, are scripted in C++.

<li>Web Browsers:

With the introduction of specialized languages such as PHP and Java, the adoption of C++ is limited for scripting of websites and web applications. However, where speed and reliability are required, C++ is still preferred. For instance, a part of Google’s back-end is coded in C++, and the rendering engine of a few open source projects, such as web browser Mozilla Firefox and email client Mozilla Thunderbird, are also scripted in the programming language.

<li>Advance Computations and Graphics:


C++ provides the means for building applications requiring real-time physical simulations, high-performance image processing, and mobile sensor applications. Maya 3D software, used for integrated 3D modeling, visual effects and animation, is coded in C++.

<li>Database Software:


C++ and C have been used for scripting MySQL, one of the most popular database management software. The software forms the backbone of a variety of database-based enterprises, such as Google, Wikipedia, Yahoo and YouTube etc.

<li>Operating Systems:


C++ forms an integral part of many of the prevalent operating systems including Apple’s OS X and various versions of Microsoft Windows, and the erstwhile Symbian mobile OS.

<li>Enterprise Software:


C++ finds a purpose in banking and trading enterprise applications, such as those deployed by Bloomberg and Reuters. It is also used in development of advanced software, such as flight simulators and radar processing.

<li>Medical and Engineering Applications:


Many advanced medical equipments, such as MRI machines, use C++ language for scripting their software. It is also part of engineering applications, such as high-end CAD/CAM systems.

<h1>Learning Java programming</h1>
<p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[17][18][19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

<h4>Application of java</h4>

<ul>
<li> Desktop GUI Applications:

Java provides GUI development through various means like Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT), Swing and JavaFX.  While AWT contains a number of pre-constructed components such as menu, button, list, and numerous third-party components, Swing, a GUI widget toolkit, additionally provides certain advanced components like trees, tables, scroll panes, tabbed panel and lists. JavaFX, a set of graphics and media packages, provides Swing interoperability, 3D graphic features and self-contained deployment model which facilitates quick scripting of Java applets and applications.

<li> Mobile Applications:

Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME or J2ME) is a cross-platform framework to build applications that run across all Java supported devices, including feature phones and smart phones. Further, applications for Android, one of the most popular mobile operating systems, are usually scripted in Java using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) or other environments.

<li> Embedded Systems:

Embedded systems, ranging from tiny chips to specialized computers, are components of larger electromechanical systems performing dedicated tasks. Several devices, such as SIM cards, blue-ray disk players, utility meters and televisions, use embedded Java technologies.   According to Oracle, 100% of Blu-ray Disc Players and 125 million TV devices employ Java.

<li> Web Applications:

Java provides support for web applications through Servlets, Struts or JSPs.  The easy programming and higher security offered by the programming language has allowed a large number of government applications for health, social security, education and insurance to be based on Java. Java also finds application in development of eCommerce web applications using open-source eCommerce platforms, such as Broadleaf.

<li> Web Servers and Application Servers:

The Java ecosystem today contains multiple Java web servers and application servers.  While Apache Tomcat, Simple, Jo!, Rimfaxe Web Server (RWS) and Project Jigsaw dominate the web server space, WebLogic, WebSphere, and Jboss EAP dominate commercial application server space.

<li> Enterprise Applications:

Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is a popular platform that provides API and runtime environment for scripting and running enterprise software, including network applications and web-services. Oracle claims Java is running in 97% of enterprise computers.  The higher performance guarantee and faster computing in Java has resulted in high frequency trading systems like Murex to be scripted in the language. It is also the backbone for a variety of banking applications which have Java running from front user end to back server end.

<li> Scientific Applications:

Java is the choice of many software developers for writing applications involving scientific calculations and mathematical operations. These programs are generally considered to be fast and secure, have a higher degree of portability and low maintenance. Applications like MATLAB use Java both for interacting user interface and as part of the core system.

In conclusion, Java is widely applicable across different types of applications. It offers cross-functionality and portability, and these features, among many others, make Java the programming language of choice for software development of a specific nature.<a href="java.html">click here to learn the java programming</a>

<h1>Learning C programming</h1>
<p>
C (/'si?/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs,[5] and used to re-implement the Unix operating system.[6] It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,[7][8] with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.

<h4>Applications</h4>
<ul>
<li>  C language is used for creating computer applications 
<li>Used in writing Embedded softwares
<li>Firmware for various electronics, industrial and communications products which use micro-controllers.
<li>It is also used in developing verification software, test code, simulators etc. for various applications and hardware products.
<li>For Creating Compiles of different Languages which can take input from other language and convert it into lower level machine dependent language.
<li>C is used to implement different Operating System Operations.
<li>UNIX kernel is completely developed in C Language.

</div>
<div class="main"><h1>Learning Html and Css</h1>
<p>Hypertext Markup language ,or HTML is the document that contain text.Web brower read and display
 document that contain .Different attribute and the tag are used for the design.
Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, allow you to specify things like the font you want on your page,
 the size of your text, whether the page is to have 2 columns, whether your text is to be in bold
 or italics, and so on. In other words, it is the part that lets you control the appearance of your web page.

You may be used to the Microsoft Word "doc" format, where everything from the text you type to the appearance
 of the document is specified in a single file, transparent to you. On the web, the raw information is specified 
 in HTML and most of the appearance is determined by the CSS.


When you write a normal document using a word processor like Microsoft Word/Office,
 your text is saved in a file with a special format. It is not simply saved as the 
 string of words you typed since the document needs to preserve things like the font
 you chose, the size of the text, which words are in bold, which italics, and so on.
 The special format includes not only your words, but all these extra information so
 that the next time Word opens your document, it can display the document with the exact appearance you created earlier.

<h1>Learning Javascript</h1>
<p>
You probably heard about JavaScript before. It borrows the name of the popular programmin
g language Java, and it has a catchy sound to it. That's why the name was chosen! The language
 isn't really related to Java, but it rides on the popular name.
<h4>Uses of JavaScript</h4>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript is a programming language that is run by most modern browsers. 
<li>It supports object-oriented programming and procedural programming. 
<li>It can be used to control web pages on the client side of the browser, server-side programs, and even mobile applications. 
<li>This language is used commonly in combination with HTML, CSS, and AJAX.

<h4>Uses of JavaScript</h4>
JavaScript is present in most web pages today. 

Chances are that the page you are looking at right now contains the code for JavaScript. 

While HTML markup language allows web developers to format content, JavaScript allows them  to make the page dynamic. 
For example, HTML allows for making text bold, creating text boxes, and creating buttons, whereas JavaScript 
allows for changing text on the page, creating pop-up messages, and validating text in text boxes to make sure
 required fields have been filled. JavaScript makes web pages more dynamic by allowing users to interact with web pages, click on elements, and change the pages.ref
